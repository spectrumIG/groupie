# groupie

Groupie is a simple, flexible library for complex RecyclerView layouts.  

Groupie lets you treat your content as logical groups and handles change notifications for you -- think sections with headers and footers, expandable groups, blocks of vertical columns, and much more.  It makes it easy to handle asynchronous content updates and insertions and user-driven content changes.  At the item level, it abstracts the boilerplate of item view types, item layouts, viewholders, and span sizes.

# Try it out:

```gradle
compile 'com.xwray:groupie:1.0.0'
```

Groupie uses Android's [data binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html) to generate view holders.  To enable code generation, add to your app module's build.gradle.

```gradle
android {
    dataBinding {
        enabled = true
    }
}
```
Bindings are only generated for layouts wrapped with `<layout/>` tags, so there's no need to convert the rest of your project (unless you want to).  
    
## Setup

Use a `GroupAdapter` anywhere you would normally use a `RecyclerView.Adapter`, and attach it to your RecyclerView as usual.

```java
GroupAdapter adapter = new GroupAdapter();
recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
```
    
## Groups

Groups are the building block of Groupie.  An individual `Item` (the unit which an adapter inflates and recycles) is a Group of 1.  You can add Groups and Items interchangeably to the adapter.

```java
groupAdapter.add(new HeaderItem());
groupAdapter.add(new CommentItem());

Section section = new Section();
section.setHeader(new HeaderItem());
section.addAll(bodyItems);
groupAdapter.add(section);
```
    
Modifying the contents of the GroupAdapter in any way automatically sends change notifications.  Adding an item calls `notifyItemAdded()`; adding a group calls `notifyItemRangeAdded()`, etc.

Modifying the contents of a Group automatically notifies its parent.  When notifications reach the GroupAdapter, it dispatches final change notifications.  There's never a need to manually notify or keep track of indices, no matter how you structure your data.

```java
section.removeHeader(); // results in a remove event for 1 item in the adapter, at position 2
```
    
There are a few simple implementations of Groups within the library:
- `Section`, a list of body content with an optional header group and footer group.  
- `ExpandableGroup`, a single parent group with a list of body content that can be toggled hidden or shown.
- `UpdatingGroup`, a list of items which can diff its previous and new contents and animate moves, updates and other changes 
    
Groups are flexible and composable.  They can be combined and nested to arbitrary depth.  For example, you could make an UpdatingSection by adding a single UpdatingGroup to the content of a Section. 

```java
public class UpdatingSection extends Section {
    private final UpdatingGroup updatingGroup;

    public UpdatingSection() {
        setHeader(new HeaderItem("Updating section!");
        updatingGroup = new UpdatingGroup();
    }

    public void update(List<Item> list) {
        updatingGroup.update(list);
    }
}
```
    
Life is messy, so groups are designed so that making new ones and defining their behavior is easy. You should make many small, simple, custom groups as the need strikes you.

You can implement the `Group` interface directly if you want.  However, in most cases, you should extend the base implementation, `NestedGroup`.  NestedGroup provides support for arbitrary nesting of groups, registering/unregistering listeners, and fine-grained change notifications to support animations and updating the adapter.
    
## Items

Groupie abstracts away the complexity of multiple item view types.  Each Item declares a view layout id, and gets a callback to `bind` the inflated layout.  That's all you need; you can add your new item directly to a `GroupAdapter` and call it a day.

The `Item` class gives you simple callbacks to bind your model object to the generated binding.  

```java
public class SongItem extends Item<SongBinding> {

    public SongItem(Song song) {
        this(song);
    }    

    @Override public void bind(SongBinding binding, int position) {
        binding.setSong(song);
    }

    @Override public int getLayout() {
        return R.layout.song;
    }
}
```

If you're converting existing code, you can reference any named views (e.g. `R.id.title`) directly from the binding instead.  
```java
    @Override public void bind(SongBinding binding, int position) {
        binding.title.setText(song.getTitle());
    }
}
```

Because of data binding, there's no need to write a view holder.  Just wrap your layout in `<layout>` tags.  (The `<data>` section is optional.)  

`layout/item_song.xml`
```xml
<layout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" 
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
    <data>
        <variable name="song" type="com.example.Song" />
    </data>

    <FrameLayout 
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" >

        <TextView
            android:id="@+id/title"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_gravity="center"
            android:text="@{song.title}"
            tools:text="A Song Title" />

    </FrameLayout>
</layout>
```

You can add a `<data>` section to directly bind a model or ViewModel, but you don't have to.  The generated view bindings alone are a huge time saver.  

Items can also declare their own column span and whether they are draggable or swipeable.

# Notes

Pre-release versions of groupie had a different package name.  The last working build was:
```gradle
compile 'com.genius:groupie:0.7.0'
```
